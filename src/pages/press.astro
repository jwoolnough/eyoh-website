        Eat Your Own Head (EYOH) are an alternative rock band based in Norwich
        and London. In May 2022 the band released their debut album 'Neck-Deep
        in the Blyth' to wide critical acclaim from BBC 6 music, Distorted Sound
        and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the album release EYOH have performed two headline tours as well
        as supporting artists such as Ditz, Acid Mothers Temple, and The
        St.Pierre Snake Invasion. The rest of 2023 includes an Ireland Tour in
        September and the band has just received funding support from Help
        Musicians for an EP release due May 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawn together by a collective yearning to play extremely loud music,
        Eat Your Own Head present an enticing blend of rich, heavy alt-rock that
        sidesteps some of the genres more obvious pitfalls and replaces them
        instead with muscular vocals, hooks, and a technical and unpredictable
        musicality.
