        Eat Your Own Head count themselves as one of the bands spearheading a
        new wave of heavy music, redefining the UK rock scene. Known for their
        unpredictable twists and turns, the band veer from floor stomping riffs
        to tender moments of dark tranquillity. Centred around an organic
        approach to creating their music, their lyrics tap into the struggles of
        navigating modern life in 2024.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their latest EP, 'The Trawler' is released 31st May 2024 via Drongo
        Records.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking inspiration from everything from Nirvana, Radiohead and Black
        Midi, the band formed in 2019 and were straight out of the blocks with
        the Hank EP in 2020, quickly landing themselves notable accolades from
        BBC 6music, The of Best Fit, Louder Than War, and Amazing Radio.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2022, Eat Your Own Head, released their debut album 'Neck-Deep In The
        Blyth', recorded by Tom Peters (Alpha Male Tea Party, Bicurious, The
        Hyena Kill) at Trapdoor Studios and mastered by Katie Tavini (Los
        Bitchos, Arlo Parks, Zuzu).
      </p>

      <p>
        The quartet have built a strong live reputation from the word go and
        have headlined shows across the UK and Ireland and supported acts such
        as The Physics House Band, Heavy Lungs, St. Pierre Snake Invasion, Sugar
        Horse, The Guru Guru and many more.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eat Your Own Head would like to thank Help Musicians for their financial
        support for releasing 'The Trawler' EP.
